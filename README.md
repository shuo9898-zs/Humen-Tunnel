A Novel Vision Inspection System for Tunnel Deformation
Detection Based on Image Processing

Abstract:

The deformation of the tunnel slope requires daily monitoring for ensuring construction safety.
The traditional approach adopts manpower to conduct daily manual measurements repetitively,
which is labor-costing, time-consuming, and inaccurate. To ameliorate this issue, a novel vision
inspection system that employs monocular camera sensors is proposed in this paper. Modern
computer vision techniques are developed in this paper to efficiently and accurately monitor the
deformation of the slope above the tunnel. Concretely, a checkerboard is set on the slope and a
camera is installed ground as the initial step for calibration purposes. Then the developed vision
inspection system in this paper to applied for tunnel deformation detection, which includes sev-
eral technical steps: a) local camera calibration and coordinates conversion; b) automatic adaptive
Region of Interest (ROI) selection; c) histogram equalization and matching & color normaliza-
tion, d) checkerboard corners detection, and e) camera shake removal. Finally, we conduct both
indoor and outdoor experiments for testing the proposed vision inspection system, and the results
show that the proposed method can automatically detect the deformation of the tunnel with high
accuracy.
